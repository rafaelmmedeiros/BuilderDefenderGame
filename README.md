# BuilderDefenderGame

- That´s a short tower defense game, made line by line fallowing classes and added some modifications for understanding of Unity Development.

# Goals

- Learning the basics of Unity.
# Observations

- It´s not a true free to grow application, there is a lot of issues and refactoring is needed to turn this in a growable game. But, works fine. Because It´ll not grow.
- Some contents are easy to grow, others are stucked.
- Some aspects are easy to balance, others don´t.
- Code standards need to be done better.
