# BuilderDefenderGame 

- That´s a short tower defense game, made line by line fallowing classes with some modifications and understanding of Unity Development.

# Goals

- Leaning the basic of Unity.
- Apply and understand SOLID principles.
- Understand how to make software that grows with little change in what has already been done.

# To improve on coming projects and observations

- It´s not a true free to grow application, there is a lot of issues and refactoring needed to turn this in a growable game. But, for the size works fine.
- Some aspects are easy to balance, others don´t. It´s not a good practice.
- Code standards need to be done a lot better...
