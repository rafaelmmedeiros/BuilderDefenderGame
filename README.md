- Why game devs use so many Singleton Pattern? Get rid of then on next project... They violete SOLID principles. There is anothers ways.
- It´s not a true free to grow application, there is a lot of issues and refactoring is needed to turn this in a growable game. But, works fine. Because It´ll not grow.
- Some contents are easy to grow horizotaly and verticaly, others are stucked.
- Some aspects are easy to balance, others don´t.
- Code standards need to be done better.
- In this Application there´s a lot of good implementation and a lot of bad implementations.

# Conclusion

- Apply the SOLID principles is a good way to do things...
